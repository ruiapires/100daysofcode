# 100daysofcode

This is a repo for the challenge 100 dasys of code. The idea is to code during 100 days producing something that we want.

This project is going to be dedicated to building my own portfloio.

The projects used in this portfolio come from certifications and tutorials that i did in the past and still do.
Some projects come from the projects given by [Free Code Camp](https://www.freecodecamp.com).
